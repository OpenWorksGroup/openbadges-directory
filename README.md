openbadges-directory
====================

Directory for searching available badges.

## Quick Start

    npm install
    npm run gulp                             #runs jshint, mocha, and then starts a watch process
    DATABASE_URL=... npm run-scripts migrate #creates the database tables needed for directory
    npm start                                #starts the actual search process

    node_modules/.bin/gulp test              #run tests
    node_modules/.bin/gulp integrationTest   #run integration tests (starts the api and makes calls against it)
    node_modules/.bin/gulp lint              #run linter
    node_modules/.bin/gulp watch             #watch

## Environment Variables

Mostly don't need environment variables at the moment, but if you don't want to use the dummy badge store
located in the project itself, you can set the BADGE_STORE environment variable. It should

    BADGE_STORE                             #full path to a JSON file of newline separated JSON objects
    API_KEY                                 #temporarily hard-coded api key for clients to use to hit the directory.
    DATABASE_URL                            #URL to mysql - format is mysql://user:pass@host/database

If you are trying to load the example store for Discovery you'll need the following

    GOOGLE_EMAIL
    GOOGLE_PASSWORD
    GOOGLE_KEY

## API

All endpoints allow for a limit and page field to modify the number of results returned, and paginate the results.

    {
      limit: int,
      page: int
    }

### /search

Returns all badges by a search criteria. Currently allowed to have no criteria, but that may be changed since what is a search
without any criteria?

*Request*

    /search?q=fulltext-search&tags=comma,separated,tags

*Response*

    {
      "data": [array of badges]
    }

### /recent

Returns all recently indexed badges. Does not accept any params.

*Response*

    {
      "data": [array of badges]
    }

### /:badgeLocation

Returns a specific badge class, based on the location url (encoded).

*Request*

    /http%3A%2F%2Fwww.no-reply.com%2F12

*Response*

    {
      "data": {
        "location": "http://www.no-reply.com/12"
        ... badge class attributes ...
      }
    }

## Trying the examples

There is an examples folder with a version of the service being proxied for a web client and a simple usecase of a
server-side directory client.

To setup:

    cd examples
    npm install
    npm run-script browserify

To run the client (from the examples folder):

    npm run-script client
    npm run-script server
    #login to http://localhost:3000/example.html

To run the server example (from the examples folder):

    npm run-script server
    node server/example


## Approach so far + future

This API is a prototype to both integrate with the initial version of openbadges-discovery (https://github.com/mozilla/openbadges-discovery),
and also to serve a starting point for an actual badge directory API for the general badge community/ecosystem.

There are lots of questions surrounding how a directory would best work, and what it would be implemented on.

In terms of crawling and indexing badges:

In terms of extending badges (and what impact that may have on searching and retrieving):
