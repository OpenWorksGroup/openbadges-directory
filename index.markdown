## Who is the Directory for?

The Directory is a community resource. Any issuer of Open Badges can register to have them indexed. The API endpoints can be used:

* in third-party apps
    * _offering users the ability to search for and browse badges_
* to integrate into existing apps
    * _for example issuer sites offering earners similar badges_
* for research

The Directory comprises a search engine for badge classes, so if you're an issuer it provides opportunities for people and organizations to find you and your badges. Client applications using the Directory API can create pathways to opportunity for badge earners. In this way, the Directory helps people within the badging ecosystem to maximize on the interoperability of badges - issuers can potentially connect their communities of earners to badges from other issuers.
